# Our (Digital) Guestbook

We want to see how you're celebrating, so please sign our digital guestbook while you watch our ceremony! We will be streaming the guestbook to our TV after the ceremony so we can see the messages while we eat brunch.

Go to [wed.tv](https://wed.tv/en/user){:target="_blank"} on your phone or tablet and enter code "jointhejarnagins" to access the guestbook. There, you can send us pictures and messages! Note: the guestbook will open to guests on December 31, 2020.
